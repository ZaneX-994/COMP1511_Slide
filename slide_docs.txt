[COMP1511 Extension Work]

Write a summary of how you made the changes that you did:

[E1:Summary] {{{
I changed map[][] into a map[][][] which can help store night realm. 

Almost every function was added one more aegument 'n_realm' which to determine
day and night.

The structure of the main function is basiclly the same. I have changed the check_map
into a nested statements since there is more than one map needs to be checked.

I found when the blocks in night realm are cleared, thre will be no need to change
day and night. So the check_night function was created to check if the night is empty.

I wrote two tests, which test for:
-the way the map is shifting after night blocks are cleared; as well as
-the way the map is shifting after day blocks are cleared

Write two tests to test your implementation of Extension 1 ("Night Realm").

[E2:Summary] {{{
To split the laser, I add one function called split_laser to achieve the goal.

Since the initial power of the laser is 4, I found the split laser will only be 
able to meet one another mirror in each direction. So there is a 'else if' condition 
for it.

Also, through the reference I found the split laser will not cause tnt block to 
explode. But the tnt block will absorb all of the energy the split laser has, which
means there will not be further movement of laser after meeting tnt block. So the 
ciatuation of destory tnt block needs to be considered in a 'if' statement.

Considering all the information given above, I wrote two tests:
-tesing if the split laser will split a third time; as well as
-tesing if the split laser can go through the tnt block
